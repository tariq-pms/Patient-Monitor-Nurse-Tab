      "pharmacology": "Anidulafungin, a semi -synthetic echinocandin, is a non -competitive inhibitor of beta - (1,3)-D-glucan synthase; this enzyme is responsible for formation of the polysaccharide, beta -(1,3) -glucan, an essential fungal cell wall component [4] . Anidulafungin is most active (MIC 90 in mcg/mL) against Candida albican s (0.06), C glabrata (0.12), C tropicalis (0.06), and C krusei (0.12) isolates, but less potent against C parapsilosis (2) and C guilliermondii (2). It has demonstrated activity against the 74 biofilms of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis . The minimum effective concentration 90 against Aspergillus fumigatus is 0.008 mcg/mL [6] . Candida isolates with reduced susceptibility to anidulafungin have been reported. The clinical relevance of these reports is unknown, but the development of drug resistance may be possible. Extensively bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%). No hepatic metabolism; not a substrate, inducer, or inhibitor of CYP450. Undergoes slow chemical degradation at physiologic temperature and pH to a ring -opened pe ptide (inactive). In a single -dose study, less than 1% was recovered in urine and approximately 30% was recovered in the feces over 9 days, of which less than 10% was intact anidulafungin. Not removed by hemodialysis [4] . In a pharmacokinetic and safety study following 3 to 5 days of anidulafungin (n=15; age 2 days to 2 years), neonates (n=8; 6 out of 8 premature) demonstrated a median weight adjusted clearance of 0.02 L/kg/hr (range 0.013 to 0.049), median half -life of 78 hours (range 40 to 219), and median exposure of 74.9 mcg*hr/mL (30.4 to 108.9). The lowest exposure was seen in 2 neonates who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a process which may alter volume of distribution and/or clearance, and there fore drug exposure. The inclusion of data from the ECMO patients in the calculations likely skewed the median pharmacokinetic values for the entire neonatal study population [1] .

      "pharmacology": "The main mechanism of action of aspirin is through inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis. Prostaglandins are produced from arachidonic acid via COX (cyclooxy genase; also known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase). Aspirin is a more specific inhibitor against COX -1 over COX -2 [18] . Aspirin is a more potent inhibitor of both prostaglandin synthesis and platelet aggregation th an its other salicylic derivatives due to the acetyl group on the aspirin molecule, which inactivates cyclooxygenase via acetylation [19] . The antithrombotic effect of aspirin occurs by an irreversible inhibition of platel et cyclooxygenase. This enzyme inhibition blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 from arachidonic acid which would reduce platelet shape change, aggregation, and the release reaction [20] [21] [22] [23] .

      "black_box_warning": "Cardiac arrest with difficult resuscitation or death during use of bupivacaine for epidural anesthesia in obstetrical patients has been reported. In most cases, this has followed use of the 0.75% concentration. Car diac arrest has occurred after convulsions resulting from systemic toxicity, presumably following unintentional intravascular injection. The 0.75% concentration should be reserved for surgical procedures where a high degree of muscle relaxation and prolong ed effect are necessary [3] [4] [1] [5] [2] [6] . 117 Pharmaco logy Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic agent. It acts by blocking the conduction and generation of nerve impulses, probably by increasing the threshold that produces electrical excitation in the nerve, by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential, and by slowing the nerve impulse propagation. Systemic absorption depends on total dose and concentration, route of administration, vascularity of administration site, and presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. Onset of action is r apid. Compared with other local anesthetics, the duration of bupivacaine is longer. Analgesia persists beyond the return of sensation. Protein binding: 95%. Distributed to some extent to all body tissue, with the highest concentrations in highly perfused o rgans. After regional block, time to peak is 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next 3 to 6 hours. Metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Mainly excreted through kidney; 6% excreted unchanged in the urine. Half -life is 2.7 hours and 8.1 hours in adults and neonates, respectively [3] [20] [1] . The bupivacaine concentrations considered to xic are 2 to 4 mg/mL [10] . Unbound bupivacaine did not accumulate in neonates and young infants (postmenstrual age, 40 to 59 weeks) administered single epidural injection (n=6; 1.5 mg/kg of 0.25%) and continuous epidural i nfusion (n=5; 0.2 mg/kg/hr starting 2 hours after single - injection). The median Cmax of unbound bupivacaine was 0.024 mg/L (0.013 to 0.12 mg/L) after a single injection and 0.052 mg/L (0.015 to 0.08 mg/L) after a continuous infusion; the corresponding valu es for total bupivacaine were 0.55 mg/L (0.37 to 1.61 mg/L) and 0.88 mg/L (0.58 to 1.91 mg/L), respectively [11] .

Total and free bupivacaine concentrations were 0.31+/ -0.17 mcg/mL and 0.047+/ -0.032 mcg/mL, respectively, for the without epinephrine group and 0.25+/ -0.09 mcg/mL and 0.062+/ -0.025 mcg/mL, respectively, for the with epinephrine group [18] . The volume of distribution, half -life, clearance, and peak concentration were 4.67 L/kg, 453 minutes, 7.9 mL/kg/min, and 0.52 mcg/mL, respectively, in 8 very low birthweight infants (700 g to 1022 g) after interpleural nerve block with bupivacaine 2 mg/kg [16] . In comparison with 11 full -term neonates (1 to 27 days of age) administered intercostal block with 1.5 mg/kg bupivacaine 0.25% , the values were 2.56 L/kg, 132 minutes, 16.93 mL/kg/min, and 0.82 mcg/mL, respectively [17] . Cardiac arrest with difficult resuscitation or death during use of bupivacaine for epidural anesthesia in obstetrical patients has been reported. In most cases, this has followed use of the 0.75% concentration. Cardiac arrest has occurred after convulsions resulting from systemic toxicity, presumably following unintentional intravascular injection. The 0.75% concentration should be r eserved for surgical procedures where a high degree of muscle relaxation and prolonged effect are necessary [3] [4] [1] [5] [2] [6] .",

      "pharmacology": "Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic agent. It acts by blocking the conduction and generation of nerve impulses, probably by increasing the threshold that produces elect rical excitation in the nerve, by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential, and by slowing the nerve impulse propagation. Systemic absorption depends on total dose and concentration, route of administration, vascularity of administration site, and presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic solution. Onset of action is rapid. Compared with other local anesthetics, the duration of bupivacaine is longer. Analgesia persists beyond the return of sensation. Protein binding: 95%. Distributed to some extent to all body tissue, with the highest concentrations in highly perfused organs. After regional block, time to peak is 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a decline to insignificant levels during the next 3 to 6 hours. Metabolized primarily in the live r via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Mainly excreted through kidney; 6% excreted unchanged in the urine. Half -life is 2.7 hours and 8.1 hours in adults and neonates, respectively [3] [20] [1] . The bupivacaine concentrations considered toxic are 2 to 4 mg/mL [10] . Unbound bupivacaine did not accumulate in neonates and young infants (postmenstrual age, 40 to 59 weeks) admini stered single epidural injection (n=6; 1.5 mg/kg of 0.25%) and continuous epidural infusion (n=5; 0.2 mg/kg/hr starting 2 hours after single - injection). The median Cmax of unbound bupivacaine was 0.024 mg/L (0.013 to 0.12 mg/L) after a single injection and 0.052 mg/L (0.015 to 0.08 mg/L) after a continuous infusion; the corresponding values for total bupivacaine were 0.55 mg/L (0.37 to 1.61 mg/L) and 0.88 mg/L (0.58 to 1.91 mg/L), respectively [11] . Free bupivacaine concent rations were not elevated in 20 newborns (including 18 premature neonates) 124 administered spinal anesthesia with 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine 1 mg/kg with or without epinephrine 1:200,000. Total and free bupivacaine concentrations were 0.31+/ -0.17 mcg/mL and 0. 047+/ -0.032 mcg/mL, respectively, for the without epinephrine group and 0.25+/ -0.09 mcg/mL and 0.062+/ -0.025 mcg/mL, respectively, for the with epinephrine group [18] . The volume of distribution, half -life, clearance, and peak concentration were 4.67 L/kg, 453 minutes, 7.9 mL/kg/min, and 0.52 mcg/mL, respectively, in 8 very low birthweight infants (700 g to 1022 g) after interpleural nerve block with bupivacaine 2 mg/kg [16] . In comparison with 11 full -term neonates (1 to 27 days of age) administered intercostal block with 1.5 mg/kg bupivacaine 0.25% , the values were 2.56 L/kg, 132 minutes, 16.93 mL/kg/min, and 0.82 mcg/mL, respectively [17] . Adverse Effect s As with other amide -type local anesthetics, adverse effects are related to excessive concentrations due to overdosage, inadvertent intravascular injection, or slow metabolism of bupivacaine. These adverse events are serious, typically dose -related, and generally affect the central nervous and cardiovascular system. Central nervous system reactions include restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, tremors, convulsions, drowsiness leading to unconsciousness and respiratory depression, nau sea, vomiting, chills, and miosis. Cardiovascular reactions include depression of myocardium, decreased cardiac output, heart -block, hypotension, bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), and cardiac arres t [3] [4] [20] [1] [5] [2] [6] . Rare allergic reactions may occur. Risks with epidural and spinal anesthesia or nerve blocks near the vertebral column include underventilation or apnea with inadvertent subarachnoid injection; and hypotension secondary to loss of sympathetic tone and respiratory paralysis or underventilation when motor blockade extends cephaladly. Other risks of epidural and spinal anesthesia include urinary retention, fecal and urinary incontinence, loss of perineal sensation, persistent anesthesia, paraesthesia, weakness, paralysis of the lower extremities and loss of sphincter control, headache, backache, septic meningitis, meningismus, and cranial nerve palsies due to traction on nerves from loss of cerebrospinal fluid. Risk of other routes of anesthesia includ e persistent anesthesia, paresthesia, weakness, paralysis, all of which may have slow, incomplete, or no recovery [3] [4] [20] [2] [6] . In pharmacokinetic studies, no adverse events were reported in 11 neonates following intercostal nerve block with bupivacaine [17] , 8 very low birthweight infants following interpleural nerve block with bupivacaine [16] , or 20 newborns (including 18 premature neonates) administered spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine [18] ."

Treatment of neonatal apnea, including post -extubation and post -anesthesia.

It is rapidly distributed in the brain, with CNS levels approximating plasma levels. Caffeine increases the respir atory center output, chemoreceptor sensitivity to CO 2, smooth muscle relaxation, and cardiac output. Oxygen consumption may be increased and weight gain may be reduced. Renal effects include diuresis and increased urinary calcium excretion. Orally administ ered caffeine citrate is rapidly and completely absorbed. There is almost no first -pass metabolism. In neonates, approximately 86% is excreted unchanged in the urine, with the remainder metabolized via the CYP1A2 enzyme system. The serum half -life of caffe ine ranges from 40 to 230 hours, decreasing with advancing postmenstrual age until 60 weeks PMA. Half -life is prolonged in infants with cholestatic hepatitis.",

      "pharmacology": "Clopidogrel is a pro drug that is metabolized to the active form (thiol derivative) which inhibits platelet aggregation by selectively and irreversibly binding to the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) P2Y12 receptor on platelets.

This action is irreversible for the remainder of the platelet lifespan (7 to 10 days). Dose -dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral dos es. Platelet inhibition reaches steady state at days 3 to 7 after therapy initiation. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually return to baseline values after treatment is discontinued, generally in about 5 days. Bioavailability is at least 50%; fo od does not affect absorption. Peak concentration achieved 30 to 60 minutes after administration. Extensively metabolized by two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into an inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% o f circulating metabolites) and one mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2). The active thiol metabolite binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation for the lifespan of the platelets.

Diluted solutions stable for 24 hours. Admixtures exhibiting a color change should not be used. There are no specific data regarding the compatibility o f dopamine and fat emulsions. Dopamine is most stable in solutions with a pH at or below 5. In alkaline solutions, the catechol moieties are oxidized, cyclized, and polymerized to colored materials. All fat emulsions have pH ranges from 6 to 9. Caution is urged when co -infusing dopamine and fat emulsion together; dopamine may degrade over time in this alkaline pH resulting in lower than expected clinical effects."

High -dose dexamethasone (eg, 0.5 mg/kg/day) has been associated with a reduction in the incidence of BPD, but also an increased risk for short -term adverse effects (hyperglycemia, hypertension, gastrointestinal perforation, infection risk) and adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (cerebral palsy (CP)) [1] [4] [5] . A review of meta -analyses looking at the timing and dosage of postnatal steroids found the development of CP was associated with early steroid use (first week of life) in patients at lower risk for BPD [1] . A prospective cohort study found that higher steroid exposure was associated with an increased risk for CP [6] . High -dose dexamethasone in the first week of life is generally not recommended for the prevention of BPD or for the treatment of BPD after the first week of life [7] [4] ; however, the judicious use of late dexamethasone may be considered for infants who cannot be weaned from the ventilator [7] [8] .

      "adverse_effects": "The February 2002 AAP and CPS statement strongly discourages routine use of dexamethasone. If dexamethasone is used for CLD risk reduction, 1) Treat only those infants at highest risk; 2) Us e lower than traditional pharmacologic doses; 3) Begin treatment after Day 7 but before Day 14 of life; 4) Do not give concurrently with indomethacin; 5) Use preservative -free drug wherever possible. The DART trial found no association with long -term morbi dity, but other studies have reported an increased risk of cerebral palsy. Most evidence suggests no increase in the incidence of ROP or the need for cryotherapy. Gastrointestinal perforation and GI hemorrhage occur more frequently in patients treated begi nning on Day 1 and in those also being treated concurrently with indomethacin. Hyperglycemia and glycosuria occur frequently after the first few doses, and one case of diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported. Blood pressure increases are common, and hypert ension occurs occasionally. Cardiac effects noted by Day 14 of therapy include increased left ventricular wall thickness with outflow tract obstruction and transient impairment of left ventricular filling, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and ST-segment depression. Other potential short -term adverse effects include sodium and water retention, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia, increased risk of sepsis, renal stones (in patients receiving furosemide), osteopenia, and inhibition of growth.

      "pharmacology": "EMLA cream, conta ining 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine, attenuates the pain response to circumcision when applied 60 to 90 minutes before the procedure. The analgesic effect is limited during the phases associated with extensive tissue trauma such as during lysis of adh esions and tightening of the clamp. Stabilizes the neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for conduction and initiation of nerve impulses. There is a theoretic concern about the potential for neonates to develop methemoglobinemia after the application of EMLA cream, because a metabolite of prilocaine can oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin. Neonates are deficient in methemoglobin NADH cytochrome b 5 reductase. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of active metabolites and then excreted renally.

After attaining t arget levels, dosage adjustments will be necessary once or twice a month, perhaps more often in preterm infants and infants with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Obtain CBC (including platelet count) and liver function tests during therapy. Monitor blood pres sure. Monitor patients with renal impairment closely during therapy (dose reduction necessary). Assess for signs of bleeding and thrombosis. Patients undergoing concomitant neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture should be monitored frequently for neurolog ical impairment indicating possible spinal or epidural hematoma [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

This is probably clinically significant only when penicillin -contai ning compounds are mixed in IV solutions or when the blood is at room temperature for several hours before the assay is performed. Dosing recommendations are based on: (1) Higher peak concentrations increase concentration -dependent bacterial killing; (2) There is a post -antibiotic effect on bacterial killing, especially when treating concurrently with a \u03b2 -lactam antibiotic; (3) There may be less toxicity with less frequent dosing, due to less renal drug accumulation.

Although the thrombocytopenia resolved spontaneously in most patients upon stopping the heparin, a high incidence of ultrasonographic -documented aortic thrombosis was seen. Long term use of therapeutic doses of heparin can lead to osteoporosis. Confirm heparin vial concentration prior to administration of the drug. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pedi atric patients when the incorrect heparin concentration was administered.",

      "pharmacology": "Lopinavir inhibits the HIV protease and prevents cleavage of the Gag -Pol polyprotein, thus reducing the probability of viral particles reaching a mature, infec tious state. Ritonavir is administered solely to increase lopinavir plasma levels. Tmax following oral administration of lopinavir/ritonavir is approximately 4 hours. Food increases bioavailability of oral solution; therefore, lopinavir/ritonavir oral solu tion should be administered with feedings. Protein binding is approximately 98% to 99% and is primarily to alpha -1-acid glycoprotein (higher affinity) and albumin. Lopinavir is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by the CYP3A4 enzyme system. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and inhibits the metabolism of lopinavir, thereby increasing lopinavir concentrations. There are many drug interactions with lopinavir involving CYP3A4. Approximately 2% and 20% of lopinavir is excreted unchanged in the urine and feces, respectively [4] . In HIV -infected infants less than 6 weeks of age (range, 3.6 to 5.9 weeks) receiving oral solution of lopinavir 300 mg/ritonavir 75 mg/m2 twice daily, the mean elimination half life was 3.7 hours (range 2.1 to 5.8 hours; n=9), according to a prospective, phase I/II, open -label study [3] .

Norepinephrine was started via central venous catheter at 0.5 mcg/kg/min and titrated every 30 minutes to target systemic artery pressure (SAP); the maximum infusion rate was 1 mcg/kg/min. Mean SAP and mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) we re both increased, with a concomitant decrease in the mean PAP/SAP ratio, resulting in increased pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output. In addition, median oxygen need was progressively reduced over time. No study patient required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [3] .",

The 12 mg/mL concentration will no longer be marketed after current supplies run out [8] . To reconstitute oral suspension, add 55 mL of water to bottle and shake well for 15 seconds. The oral suspension has a concentration of 6 mg/mL after reconstitution. Stable for 17 days refrigerated or 10 days if stored at room temperature [3] . Oseltamivir oral suspension contains 2 g of sorbitol per 75 mg dose, which exceeds the maximum daily sorbitol limit in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, and may cause dyspepsia and diarrhea in these patients [3] . Emergency Compounding During shortage of commercially manu factured oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) oral suspension, the suspension can be compounded using oseltamivir 75 mg capsules. The compounded suspension yields a 6 mg/mL concentration (same as commercially 621 available 6 mg/mL suspension) and total volume adequate for 1 patient for a 5 -day course of treatment or a 10 -day course of prophylaxis. The compounded suspension is only to be used in emergency situations, and should not be used for convenience or when the commercially manufactured suspension is available [3] . \uf0b7 Directions for Compounding \uf0b7 Determine dose and total volume required for compounding. For a dose of 15 mg or less, total volume is 37.5 mL; for 30 mg, total volume is 75 mL; for 45 mg, total volume is 100 mL; for 60 mg, total volume is 125 mL; for 75 mg, total volume is 150 mL. If the dose is between these doses, default to the next greater dose and volume. \uf0b7 Determine number of capsules, volume of water, and volume of vehicle required. Place specified amount of water in to a polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) or glass bottle (2.5 mL for 3 capsules; 5 mL for 6 capsules; 7 mL for 8 capsules; 8 mL for 10 capsules; 10 mL for 12 capsules). \uf0b7 Transfer contents of required number of oseltamivir 75 mg capsules into the PET or glass bottle and gently swirl for at least 2 minutes; slowly add the specified volume of vehicle (cherry syrup, Ora -Sweet(R) sugar -free, or simple syrup: 34.5 mL for 3 capsules (total volume, 37.5 mL); 69 mL for 6 capsules (total volume, 75 mL); 91 mL for 8 cap sules (total volume, 100 mL); 115 mL for 10 capsules (total volume, 125 mL); 137 mL for 12 capsules (total volume, 150 mL). \uf0b7 Close the bottle and shake well for 30 seconds to dissolve active drug; stable for 35 days when refrigerated (2 to 8 degrees C) or for 5 days at room temperature.",

Pharmacokinetics fit a 3 -compartment model, with a c entral Vd of 100 mL/kg and a steady -state Vd of 350 mL/kg. Rapid and slow distribution half -life are 1 and 6 minutes, respectively. Approximately 70% protein bound, the majority to alpha - 1-acid-glycoprotein. Unlike other opioid analgesics, remifentanil con tains an ester linkage in its structure and is susceptible to rapid hydrolysis in tissues and blood by nonspecific esterases (to essentially inactive metabolites). It is not a substrate for pseudocholinesterase; therefore, normal duration of action is expe cted in patients with atypical cholinesterase. The lung and liver are not significant contributors in the metabolism of remifentanil. Total body clearance generally correlates with total body weight, except in severely obese patients, when clearance correl ates better with ideal body weight. Terminal elimination half -life is 10 to 20 minutes, however, the effective biological half -life is 3 to 10 minutes. Renal or hepatic impairment do not affect the pharmacokinetics [3] . The half -life of remifentanil was similar in all anesthetized pediatric patients (n=42) undergoing elective surgery or diagnostic procedures; however, infants up to the age of 2 years experienced higher clearance rates compared with older children. Clearanc e rates were 90 mL/kg/min in 5 days to 8 weeks of age infants, 92 mL/kg/min in children older than 2 months to younger than 2 years, 76 mL/kg/min in children 2 to 6 years of age, and 46 to 59.7 mL/kg/min in 7 to younger than 18 years. Corresponding Vd were 452.8 mL/kg (significantly different from other groups), 307.9 mL/kg, 240.1 mL/kg, and 223 to 248.9 mL/kg, respectively. [10] [3] . Remifentanil hydrochloride is a mu -opioid agonist exhibiting analgesic effects with a rapid onset and a short duration of action. Unlike fentanyl, duration of action does not increase with prolon ged administration. Effects are antagonized by opioid antagonists (eg, naloxone). Pharmacokinetics fit a 3 -compartment model, with a central Vd of 100 mL/kg and a steady -state Vd of 350 mL/kg. Rapid and slow distribution half -life are 1 and 6 minutes, resp ectively. Approximately 70% protein bound, the majority to alpha - 1-acid-glycoprotein.

It has a rapid to intermediate onset depending on dose and intermediate duration. It acts by competing for cholinergic receptors at the motor end -plate. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and edrophonium. Plasma levels of rocuronium follow a three compartment open m odel following intravenous administration. The rapid distribution half -life is 1 to 2 minutes and the slower distribution half -life is 14 to 18 minutes. Onset of clinical effect usually occurs within 2 minutes and the duration ranges from 20 minutes to 2 h ours. Larger doses (0.9 to 1.2 mg/kg) lead to more rapid onset and longer duration of clinical effect. It can have differential effects on various muscle groups (eg, laryngeal vs adductor pollicis vs diaphragm). The onset of laryngeal adductor paralysis is significantly slower with rocuronium compared with succinylcholine. Despite this difference, rocuronium has the fastest onset of any currently available nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. Average half -life in newborns is 1.1 hours.

      "pharmacology": "Sildenafil is a selective phosphodiesterase type -5 (PDE5) inhibitor. This inhibition leads to accumulation of cyclic GMP in pulmonary smooth muscle cells, causing pulmonary vascular relaxation. It may also pot entiate the effect of inhaled nitric oxide. Pharmacokinetics in neonates receiving sildenafil, both intravenously and orally, are highly variable [12] [5] . Oral absorption is rapid in adu lts with approximately 40% bioavailability; peak concentrations are reached in 30 to 120 minutes. Protein binding is 94%. It is metabolized primarily by hepatic CYP3A4 to an active metabolite (N - desmethyl sildenafil) that also has PDE5 inhibitory activity [13] . The terminal half -life of sildenafil in neonates on Day 1 of life is estimated to be 56 hours, and that of the metabolite 10 hours. This compares to adult data where both sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half-lives of 4 hours. Clearance increases rapidly (triples) in the first week of life, likely related to both maturation and improvements in patient hemodynamics. Patients with significant hepatic or renal dysfunction have reduced clearance. Significant i ncreases in sildenafil concentrations may occur when used concomitantly with drugs that are CYP3A4 inhibitors: eg, fluconazole, erythromycin, amlodipine, and cimetidine [13] . 751 Adverse Effects Use in neonates should be res tricted and considered experimental. Data in neonates remain limited. The most concerning short -term adverse effects are worsening oxygenation and systemic hypotension [1] . There is one case report of bleeding after circu mcision in a neonate receiving chronic therapy [10] . Use with caution in infants with sepsis. Sildenafil causes transient impairment of color discrimination in adults, and there is concern that it could increase the risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity if used in extremely premature infants. In a study of neonates receiving sildenafil for at least weeks (n=22), positive ocular findings were reported in 4 patients, none of which were considered drug -related [11] . Sildenafil is a selective phosphodiesterase type -5 (PDE5) inhibitor. This inhibition leads to accumulation of cyclic GMP in pulmonary smooth muscle cells, causing pulmonary vascular relaxation. It may also potentiate the effect of inhaled nitric oxide. Pharmacokinetics in neonates receiving sildenafil, both intravenously and orally, are highly variable [12] [5] .

      "pharmacology": "The exact mechanism of action of topiramate is unknown; however, 4 properties that may contribute to antiepileptic and antimigraine efficacy include a blockage of voltage - dependent sodium channels, an augmentation of gamma -aminobutyrate acid (GABA) activity at some subtypes of the GABA -A receptors, antagonism of AMPA/kainate subtype of the glutamate r eceptor, and inhibition of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, particularly isozymes II and IV [3] . Neuroprotective effects appear to be related to AMPA and kainate receptor inhibition, blockade of sodium channels, high -voltag e activated calcium currents, carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes, and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) [2] . Topiramate serum concentrations and pharmacokinetics varied, based upon the level of hypothermia and use of concomitant phenobarbital in 13 full -term newborns with hypoxic -ischemic encephalopathy who received either deep hypothermia (DH; n=5) or mild hypothermia (MH; n=8) and either topiramate monotherapy (n=6) or with concomitant phenobarbital (n=7). All patients received a topiramate dose of 5 mg/kg every 24 hours for 3 days, starting with the initiation of hypothermia. Serum concentrations were lower in patients who received both MH and phenobarbital (NS). The coefficient of variability was greater in t he DH group than the MH group (p=0.005), likely due to more irregular absorption and elimination. In those patients who attained virtual steady state (n=9), lower AUC, lower average serum concentration, and a longer half -life were seen in the DH compared t o the MH group (318.1+/ -101.6 vs 366.2+/ -48.1 mg/L/hr, 13.25+/ -4.2 vs 15.26+/ -2 mg/L, and 48.82+/ -4.6 vs 29.03+/ - 23.8 hours, respectively; all NS). Patients who received concomitant phenobarbital had lower minimum serum concentrations than those on topira mate monotherapy (8.7+/ -2.9 vs 11.67+/ -0.9 mg/L; p=0.032), with lower maximum and average serum concentrations, lower AUC, shorter half -life, and higher clearance (15.38+/ -5.3 vs 814 19.87+/ -1.9 mg/L, 12.6+/ -3.7 vs 15.66+/ -1.6 mg/L, 302.4+/ -89.7 vs 375.8+/ -37.4 mg/L/hr, 26.46+/ -17.7 vs 42.88+/ -19.1 hours, 17.92+/ -6.2 vs 13.42+/ -1.4 mL/kg/hr, respectively; all NS). Serum concentrations within the reference range of 5 to 20 mg/L were achieved in most patients [6] . Adverse Effect s When used for neuroprotection in concert with hypothermia for hypoxic -ischemic encephalopathy (n=27), mild and reversible acidosis was seen in patients receiving deep hypothermia (DH); metabolic acidosis was not seen with mild hypothermia (MH). In addit ion, short course topiramate did not cause acid -base imbalance, nephrolithiasis, or ophthalmological concerns [1] .

Due to the variability in pharmacokinetic parameters, peak a nd trough concentrations have been recommended to provide more individualized dosing in neonates [4] If peak concentrations are measured, draw 60 minutes after end of infusion. Data are lacking for correlating pharmacokin etic/pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin with its clinical efficacy in the neonatal population [5] . The following recommendations are based primarily on adult data. Based on pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin a nd their presumed similarity among different age groups, these recommendations may be applicable to neonates [6] . Recommended trough concentration range for native valve endocarditis (non -MRSA) is 10 to 15 mcg/mL [7] . Recommended trough concentration range for bacterial meningitis is 15 to 20 mcg/mL [8] . Many experts recommend a trough of 15 to 20 mcg/mL when treating MRSA bacteremia, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, pneumonia, complicated skin and soft -tissue infections, or bone/joint infections [3] [1] .

      "pharmacology": "The main source of vitamin D is vitamin D 3, which is synthesized in the skin t hrough exposure to ultraviolet B (UV -B) radiation. UV -B in the range of 290 to 315 nm initiates the synthesis of vitamin D 3 by converting 7 -dehydrocholesterol into previtamin D3, which is further converted to vitamin D 3. Vitamin D 3 binds to vitamin D -bindi ng protein and is transported to the liver for 25 -hydroxylation to 25(OH) -D (calcidiol). Calcidiol undergoes further hydroxylation in the kidney and other tissues to calcitriol (1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D) (1,25 -OH 2-D), the active form of vitamin D. Calcitrio l stimulates the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorous, renal reabsorption of filtered calcium, and mobilization of calcium and phosphorous from bone. As a supplement, vitamin D 3 has been shown to be more effective in raising 25(OH) -D levels whe n compared with vitamin D 2.

In a phase III randomized trial (n=1684), the combination of 6 weeks of zidovudine plus 3 doses of nevirapine or the com bination of 6 weeks of zidovudine plus nelfinavir and lamivudine for 2 weeks was associated with a lower intrapartum transmission rate when compared with zidovudine alone in infants born to women who received no 866 antenatal antiretroviral therapy (2.2% versu s 2.5% versus 4.9%, respectively). The zidovudine/nelfinavir/lamivudine regimen was associated with increased toxicity (eg, neutropenia) [6] . Treatment of HIV -infected infants with combination antiretroviral therapy shou ld be done in consultation with a pediatric infectious disease expert.",

      "pharmacology": "Zidovudine is a nucleoside analog that inhibits HIV replication by interfering with viral reverse transcriptase. It is converted intracellularly in several steps to a triphosphate derivativ e, metabolized via hepatic glucuronidation, then renally excreted. Protein binding is approximately 25%. Zidovudine distributes into cells by passive diffusion and is relatively lipophilic. The CSF: plasma ratio is 0.24. The relationship between 863 serum conc entration and clinical efficacy is unclear. The oral syrup is well -absorbed, but only 65% bioavailable due to significant first -pass metabolism. The serum half -life in term newborns is 3 hours, declining to 2 hours after 2 weeks of age. In preterm infants less than 33 weeks gestation, half -life during the first two weeks of life ranges from 5 to 10 hours, decreasing to 2 to 6 hours afterward [7] [2] [9] .
